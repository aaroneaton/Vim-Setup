The snimate plugin now has a separate repository for maintaining snippets files. 

This project is hosted on Github.

https://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets

This script contains snippets files for various programming languages for the famous snipMate plugin. This repository is community-maintained and many people have contributed snippet files and other improvements already.

vim-snipmate was originally started by Michael Sanders who has now unfortunately abandoned the project. Rok Garbas is now maintaining a fork of the project in hopes of improving the existing code base.
